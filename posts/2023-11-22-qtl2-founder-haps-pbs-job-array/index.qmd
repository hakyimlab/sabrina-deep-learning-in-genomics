### Prepare Chromosome Inputs

We first generate chromosome-wide input files with Dan's original make_qtl2_inputs function locally, because I'm having so much trouble creating a conda environment with both R and python's pysam libraries.

for i in {1..3}
do
    qsub -v CHR=${i} qtl2-founder-haps-by-chromsome.pbs 
done


/home/s1mi/Github/deep-learning-in-genomics/posts/2023-11-22-qtl2-founder-haps-pbs-job-array
i=1
qsub -v CHR=${i} qtl2-founder-haps-by-chromsome.pbs 

```
