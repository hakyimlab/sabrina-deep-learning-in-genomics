BioMart is a database with gene annotations for various species, builds, etc. We can use the package biomaRt package to query information. 

### Install biomaRt

```{r}
if (!requireNamespace("BiocManager", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("BiocManager")
BiocManager::install("biomaRt")

```

### Example 1: Getting a list of human genes and their TSS in hg38

```{r}
library(biomaRt)

```
