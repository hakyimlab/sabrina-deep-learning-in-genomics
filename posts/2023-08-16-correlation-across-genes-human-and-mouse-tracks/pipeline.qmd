title: Running Enformer across all rn7 genes (continued)
author: Sabrina Mi
description: We pick up where we left off last time with predicting epigenome across all genes, trying to run the Enformer pipeline on intervals we missed the first time because of batching issues. Additionally, we'll try using the added mouse head parameter

We'll reuse the `intervals.txt` file that spanned all TSS in the rn7 genome.

## Human Head

```{bash}
module load conda

conda activate /lus/grand/projects/TFXcan/imlab/shared/software/conda_envs/enformer-predict-tools

cd /home/s1mi/Github/shared_pipelines/enformer_pipeline

python3 scripts/enformer_predict.py --parameters /home/s1mi/Github/deep-learning-in-genomics/posts/2023-08-16-correlation-across-genes-human-and-mouse-tracks/all_genes_reference_human_head.json

```
